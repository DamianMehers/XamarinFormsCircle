# XamarinFormsCircle
A component that lets you create segmented circles in Xamarin forms, created during [a Live Coding session](https://youtu.be/aTcXQJ1ZUnY)

This is a complete standalone solution, however the Circle class itself is [here](XamarinFormsCircle/XamarinFormsCircle/Controls/Circle.cs) with example XAML [here](XamarinFormsCircle/XamarinFormsCircle/MainPage.xaml)
